# Singleton

## The main idea of singleton is to create on instance from the class if this instance so expensive for you during runtime, in memory, perfomance, CPU, ...etc


## Exmaples:
- Logger:
A logger is a common use case for the Singleton pattern. In a multi-threaded environment, multiple instances of a logger can result in interleaved logs and potential issues. By implementing the logger as a Singleton, you ensure that all log messages go to the same instance, maintaining consistency and avoiding conflicts.

- Database Connection Pool:
In applications that require database connectivity, creating a new database connection for every request can be expensive. Instead, you can use a connection pool to manage a set of reusable database connections. Implementing the connection pool as a Singleton allows all components of the application to share the same pool of connections, improving efficiency and avoiding resource wastage.

- Configuration Manager:
A configuration manager is responsible for managing application settings and configurations. It loads configuration values from files or other sources and provides access to those values throughout the application. Implementing the configuration manager as a Singleton ensures that all components of the application access the same configuration data, avoiding inconsistencies and simplifying access.

- Cache Manager:
A cache manager is used to store frequently accessed data in memory, improving performance by reducing the need to fetch data from slower data sources. Implementing the cache manager as a Singleton allows all parts of the application to access the same cache instance, ensuring data consistency and avoiding redundant caches.

- Object Factories:
In scenarios where you have complex object creation logic or need to manage a limited set of resources, a Singleton can be used as an object factory. The Singleton ensures that only one instance of the factory exists, controlling the creation and management of objects, and providing a central point of access.
